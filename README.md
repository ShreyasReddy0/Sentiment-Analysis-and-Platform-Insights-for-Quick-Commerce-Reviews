# Sentiment Analysis and Platform Insights for Quick Commerce Reviews

This project focuses on analyzing user reviews from quick commerce platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart to improve customer experience. Using machine learning (Logistic Regression) and natural language processing (NLP), it classifies sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) from review texts and provides useful insights based on user demographics like age, gender, and location.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of reviews (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression
- Comparison with SVM for performance benchmarking
- Dashboard-style insights:
  - City-wise sentiment trends
  - Age/gender-based satisfaction levels
  - Impact of discounts on user sentiment

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- **Input Format:** CSV dataset with reviews and user metadata

## Project Goal
To help quick commerce platforms understand customer feedback better and make data-driven decisions to improve service quality and user satisfaction.
